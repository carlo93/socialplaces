<h2>PHP Laravel Project</h2>

<p>This is a complete <b>MVCâ‰¤/b> project consisting of a contact form on the initial landing page which will send a email response to the user that completes this form.</p>
    
    <p>Also included:</p>
    
    - DB Contact Table which stores the form data submitted on the contact page.
    - DB Gender Table which is relational to the contact table in terms of capturing and retrieving the gender name.
    - The Contact form submits via ajax and does not include the vue js framework functionality as this has been something I have struggled to implement successfully amongst other delaying factors.
    - Registration and Login pages are also accessible through the navigation bar on the top of the pages.
    - On succesful login the user lands on the dashboard page which consists of a datatable displaying the contact details of the users who submitted the form.
    - The logged in user will be able to see the content of each entry through a modal which is accessible once they click the show button.
    - The logged in user can also delete table entries via the delete button per row.
    - Filtering and report capturing is also made available through the datatable.
